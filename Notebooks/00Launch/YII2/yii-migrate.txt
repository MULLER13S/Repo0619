1---在config文件中组件中配置authManager:
'components'=>[
	'authManager' => [
            'class' => 'yii\rbac\DbManager',
            'itemTable' => 'auth_item',
            'assignmentTable' => 'auth_assignment',
            'itemChildTable' => 'auth_item_child',
            'ruleTable'=>'auth_rule',

					],
				]	

2---在./config/console.php中同样需要配置如上：



Problem was quite simple: The configuration was not used. 
yii migrate is a console command and usually the configuration for such commands is placed in a seperated file.

In case of yii2-app-base template, 
from which I have created my application, 
there is a config/console.php configuration file where the authManager needs to be declared. 
It is not sufficient to have it in the config/web.php declared only.

In case of yii2-app-advanced the authManager should be declared in console/config/main.php 
and not in the backend or frontend configuration files.			
	
3---在windows环境下，进入yii根目录，运行yii.bat。然后打开cmd，进入根目录，也就是yii.bat所在的目录：
F:\phpStudy\WWW\Yiichina\Yiichina;
执行数据库迁移命令：yii migrate --migrationPath=@yii/rbac/migrations；
这样会在数据库中生成auth_assignment,auth_item,auth_item_child,auth_rule和migration五张表；
